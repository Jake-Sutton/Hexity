# Hexity Commandline Data Processor
### What is Hexity?

Hexity is an experimental, commandline interface for formatting large datasets
in many common formats. A CSV for example, may be loaded up as a pool of 'Objects'
where the values from the columns of the CSV become traits of objects.

From there, we hope to create method by which one many relate different datasets, in different formats to glean insights by linking traits which reoccur.

This is an experimental effort which currently exists as a commandline tool targeting
the Mono framework for Crossplatform C# development.
